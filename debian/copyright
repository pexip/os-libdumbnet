Comment: Several files contained in this package stem from BSD origins and still bear
  the old 4-clause BSD license. The only copyright holders of those files are
  the University of California (who have retroactively removed the "ad clause")
  and Dug Song (who has placed this software under the 3-clause BSD), so the
  3-clause BSD license applies uniformly to all files.
